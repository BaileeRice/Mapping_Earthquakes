# Mapping_Earthquakes

OVERVIEW:

In this module, you will use the Leaflet.js API to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.
